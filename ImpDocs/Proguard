What is ProGuard?
ProGuard is a free java tool in Android, which helps us to do the following,

Shrink(Minify) the code: Remove unused code in the project.
Obfuscate the code: Rename the names of class, fields, etc.
Optimize the code: Do things like inlining the functions.
In short, ProGuard makes the following impact on our project,

It reduces the size of the application.
It removes the unused classes and methods that contribute to the 64K method counts limit of an Android application.
It makes the application difficult to reverse engineer by obfuscating the code.
