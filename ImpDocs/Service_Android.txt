Service:
It is one of the component of the Android.
Here application either can perform a longer running task without the interaction of user
or supply any functionality for other apps to use.

Services can be started using Context.startService() and Context.bindService().

Context.startService():-> When a long running operation runs in the background(User is not directly interacting with the application).
						Context.startService() ask the system to schedule a work of service to be run until service or someone else
						explicitly stop it.
						
Context.bindService():-> Using this an application exposes some of its functionality to other applications.
						It allows long standing connection to be made to the service in order to interact with it.
						
Service Lifecycle:
	Context.startService()--> onCreate(){if needed}--> onStartCommand() --> Context.stopService()/stopSelf().
	
For started Service there are two major mode of operations depending upon onStartCommand() return value.
1) START_STICKY:	It is used for the services that are explicitly started and stopped as needed.
2) START_NOT_STICKY  
   or START_REDELIVER_INTENT: It is used for the services that should only remain running while processing any commmand sent to them.
   
   
Context.bindService():-> It is used to obtain persistent connection to a service.
Lifecycle
Context.bindService() --> onCreate() --> onBind()// it doesn't call onStartCommand().
