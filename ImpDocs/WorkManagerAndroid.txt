WorkManager(WM):-> 
::-> It is an API that is used to schedule reliable, asynchronous tasks that are expected
   to run even if app exits or device restart.
:-> It is suitable & recommended replacement of all previous Background scheduling APIs as GCMNetworkManager
	FirebaseJobDispatcher etc.
	
WorkManager has number of other key benefits as belows:
1) Work Constraints : example-- Run only when the device is on wifi, or idle,or when it has sufficient storage space etc.
2) Robust Scheduling : It schedule work to run "one time" or "repeatedly" using flexible scheduling windows. 
					   Schedule work is stored in internally managed sqlite DB and WM takes care of ensuring that this 
					   work persistently and reschedule across the device reboot.
3) Flexible Retry policy: Retry policy 
4) Work Chaining.
