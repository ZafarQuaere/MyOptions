Firebase Cloud Messaging

Firebase supports 3 types of notification :
1) Notification msg
2) Data msg
3) Msg with both Notification and data payload.

There are 2 conditions for these notification
i) When application is in background.
ii) When application is in foreground.

Background: App receive notification payload in notification tray, and handle the data payload when user taps on notification.

ForeGround : App receives the notification msg and payloads.


Basically two services are used :
1) FirebaseInstanceIdService and (onTokenReferesh()).
2) FirebaseMessagingService. (onMessageReceived()).
