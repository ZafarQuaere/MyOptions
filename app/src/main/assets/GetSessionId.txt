You can choose who and how many users you want to add to your Flight Pass. The fewer the number of users, the lower the price. With British Airways Flight Pass, you may add from one to six users to your Flight Pass.    &bull; Each passenger can travel alone or along with one or more of the other Users in a single booking. If a single passenger is traveling on one booking, he(she) must be an adult.   &bull; One flight refers to a one-way flight for one passenger, and will consume one flight credit from your Flight Pass. This applies to Adults (12+) and children (2 - 11 years).   &bull; Choose multiple users in order to allow your Flight Pass to be shared.   &bull; You can add users either at the time of Pass purchase or within the following 24 -hours. If you have chosen the Freedom Option (the four- hour advance booking limit), then you may add users at any time and the 24- hour restriction does not apply.   &bull; Once you have purchased your British Airways Flight Pass, you cannot increase the maximum number of users.   &bull; For each user, you will need to fill all relevant details, including, name, date of birth, e-mail, telephone contact and proof of identity (e.g. passport, driver's license or National ID card).   Example   &bull; Sam has a Flight Pass with six Flights and 2 Users    &bull; He adds himself and his wife to his Flight Pass   &bull; He books a return trip with the Flight Pass for both of them by using four of the flights from his Flight Pass.   &bull; The following month, Sam redeems the last two flights of the Flight Pass by booking a round- trip for himself.

            "Ans": "Travel Zone defines the set of destinations where you can fly to with your Flight Pass. You can pick the Travel Zone that covers all the destinations you want to fly to. It can be a single city, a group of cities, a country or a group of countries. It can also be a Global Travel Zone covering all worldwide network of that airline. Typically, a travel zone allows travel on all airline operated flights both ways (to and fro) between a hub city of that airline and a set of selected destinations. You can select more destinations to keep more flexibility in your travel plans. However, to save more, you should try to select only your required destinations. Some Travel Zones may allow you to book one-way tickets, while others may allow you to book round trip only.Some Travel Zones may allow you to book ONLY one-way tickets from one city to another (and not allow the reverse direction ticket). This is normally done to offer more savings to travelers, as sometimes prices of one direction flights are much more cheaper than the reverse direction. Example. Sydney - This travel zone is offered to AirAsia X flyers and allows travel both ways (to and fro) between Kuala Lumpur and SydneyRussia - This travel zone is offered to Estonian Air flyers and allows travel both ways (to and fro) between Tallinn and Russia (Moscow, Petersburg)China & Taiwan - Travel valid on AirAsia X between Kuala Lumpur and China\/Taiwan (including Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Hangzhou, Xi'an and Taipei)Asia & Australia - Travel valid on AirAsia X between Kuala Lumpur and all destinations in Asia & Australia.* Flight Pass features, rules and fees may vary across Optiontown airline partners",

            "Ans": "Advance booking or advance booking limit refers to the minimum number of days before travel when you must book your flight. Advance Booking can be anywhere from 1 day to up to 180 days. It's one of the features of the Flight Pass that you can select as per your travel need.Example, a one-day Advance Booking means you must book your flight at least one-day before your intended flight departure.  Earlier the advance booking limit, the cheaper the price. So, a 180-day limit is cheaper than a one-day limit.You may select your Advance Booking limit based on how early or late you wish to make your flight booking. For instance, if you normally book your flights seven days before travel, then choose the \"7 day\" Advance Booking. However, if you can book early, then we suggest you to choose the earliest possible Advance Booking limit to earn maximum savings. You may choose the 30 day, 60 day, 90 day or even 180 Day Advance Booking limit to get more savings.

      "Text": "I would like to report an excellent experience I have had with one of your Optiontown.com staff members, Mr Paul Smith. I have a booking with AirAsiaX to fly to\/from Melbourne \/ KL. I was due to leave on 3 February 2013, but because of my ill-health, I had to change the date. Associated with this booking, I had both an Upgrade option and an Empty Seat option registered with Optiontown.com. <br>\n<br>\nMaking the changes to my Optiontown.com choices required a number of tricky transactions, which were further hampered by my inability to function very well due to my ill-health. This is where the skills, friendliness and helpfulness of your staff member Mr Paul Smith came to my rescue. This included him ringing me back to keep me informed of progress so I did not worry, and also doing the final part of the transaction on the following day, including ringing me again to finalise the transaction. <br>\n<br>\nI must admit I was very surprised with the high quality of customer service as often this is not a strength of companies who do most of their business online, such as Optiontown.com does. I only recently took the leap of faith and began to use Optiontown.com, and was lucky enough to get one of my upgrades on a recent trip I took. This is a fantastic company you have which is providing an appreciated service at a reasonable cost. I wish you well in your future business endeavors. However, I believe if you have staff such as Mr Paul Smith to complement your service that you will surely succeed at a high level. Again, thank you for providing the environment to enable such excellent customer service - I would classify your customer service as one of the showpieces of your business. <br>\nPlease thank Mr Paul Smith personally for me. His attention has given me peace-of-mind and enabled me to focus on my health and look forward to my amended travel plans. <br>\nIt has also left a warm glow about your company, which I will share with colleagues and friend in the hope you get more business.

But however we did get our empty seat option fro both of us on the flight home, it was fantastic, both had 3 seats each.

And for this 11 hours flying, i got upgraded for BOTH SECTORS! what a big luck on my birthday :D<br> <br> For my first flight from KUL to CHC, I need to wait 5hour...s before flight before i got upgraded. I really need this upgrade so bad as i slept in Airport due to early morning flight to Christchurch. I still did not know that i am upgraded till i lined in a queue and the front desk told me that i am in Premium class. I just cant believe i now had a free baggage, free 2 meals, and free confort pillow and blanket for a whole journey.<br> <br> For my second flight bound to back to Kuala Lumpur, it was pretty awesome as it is an overnight flight. I sat next to a guy who just upgraded by optiontown too :D<br> <br> What an experience..<br> <br> Thanks Optiontown for letting me experiencing premium class on my birthday.

There is nothing more exciting than receiving an upgrade approval prior to a flight, and knowing that the flight ahead is going to be a lot morecomfortable than it would be without UTo and ESo. Paying full Premium fare is out of reach for most private travellers, so having such options are a fantastic product for most passengers.

      "Text": "I'd like to be adopted please.<br\/><br\/>Mum, its nothing personal, but I now have a hankering to be adopted by Dr. Vijay Mallya chairman of Kingfisher Airlines. I had a choice of airline from London to Bangalore - BA or Kingfisher - flight times were better on BA, but the thought of a few more inches of legroom with Kingfisher were just calling me loudly. Its a near enough 10 hour flight with one direction overnight! So Kingfisher it was. Visa collected, flight booked. Then I spotted \"Upgrade Travel Option\" through \"Option Town\"who's tagline is along the lines of \"get an upgrade to business or first for 75% less\". Hmm.. interesting, so I sign up. Desparately dubious about it...have to call OptionTown in India to throw my credit card over the fence - pay my sign up fee for each way on the flight that I want to be considered for upgrade. (about total), plus the GBP 217 each way that I was quoted for the upgrade. My card was charged, on the proviso that if I didn't get the upgrade I get my money credited back. They promise to let me know I'm upgraded 4 hours before the flight. So that's an upgrade to first class for GBP 217 for a 10 hour flight, that gives me a fully flat bed. The cost when I looked on the website for first both ways was TWO GRAND sterling. (which is definitely out of my price bracket!!). My economy class was actually cheaper than BA at GBP 390, so its not like I paid over the odds to start with.<br\/><br\/>There was definitely part of me that was extremely dubious, that I'd never see my money again and it was all some elaborate scam, but you know I thought it must be real because its on the Kingfisher website (that'll be me trusting everything I read on the internet...) I searched and searched and could only find one reference to the service, on an obscure travel blog - and all they was \"new service launched\". So, I was a very happy bunny when I get the notification 36 hours before I fly that I've been upgraded - excited all the way to the executive lounge. Hurray. No longer am I one of the great unwashed at Heathrow terminal 4, no more fighting for a seat, an overpriced drink, and then joining a queue to sit in (admittedly 34 inches) of seat pitch (comfort) cattle class for 10 hours. There are no two ways about it. It was an amazing experience. From the greeting as you get on the plane (my original seat was a \"turn left\" but it was an aisle seat, so I opted for 3k and the window), the acres and acres of space, three windows in my \"suite\",thats right I had three windows! And no neighbour - ok so there was a seat there, but it was empty. Wow all this space and I get to stretch out as well. An amazing toiletry pack, with a wooden handbag sized hairbrush, smellies from Salvatore Ferragamo, jim jams (oh I'm sorry, a sleep suit), slippers. Papers, magazines, hot towels, man alive where am I going to put all this stuff? Ha, that's why I got the spare seat then... Then Vijay, or do you want me to start calling you Pops already?, appears on the screen - the 17inch (I think it was 17inch, it needed to be that big, being at the end of my acres long suite...) screen and tells me that he's personally selected all the crew on board, and he's told them to treat me as if I were a guest in his home. Dr Mallya, after the Kingfisher First experience, I'm not sure\njust visiting is going to be enough for me.<br\/><br\/>(Due to the long length, this testimonial has been divided into two parts.

I've been wracking my brains as to what wowed me the most - well it started with the onboard camera, that appears to be attached to the underside of the plane, so I could watch the runway from the bottom of the plane as we taxied, then watch London as we took off, and then the lights of whatever part of southern England we flew over, then Europe. Clearly I'm easily pleased. But seriously, what wowed me the most? - there's no one thing, but there were plenty of them - it started with the offer of champagne - Dom Perignon no less, and yes I would like to drink my champagne in the bar - and yes I sat on the funky cream leather sofa watching Europe scoot past as I lived the high life and ordered my dinner. After retiring to my suite, dinner (and obviously more fizz) was served. Oh boy. The marvellous tuna to start, and then a fabulous vegetable thali - served on a beaten silver platter. (ok it might not have been real, but I'm probably not the right person to judge, but wow, amazing food and superb presentation). I'm not sure I will ever be able to get back to a Ryanair sandwich again. (and it would probably cost me as much as this upgrade anyways!) My fully flat bed was obviously prepared for me - and then the stars came out. Literally, the ceiling goes a midnight blue colour and stars appear, so I'm not only in heaven, I can see it as well. Waking to breakfast and coffee served from silver jugs (I'm going to have to change the coffee machine at home now..) there was just enough time to move my chair into every position possible, (I'm sorry folks, its the little things), test out the massage options on it (yes seriously good), work my way through a little \"Kingfisher Radio\" and then we were in Bangalore. And of course I love being first off the plane, and seeing my bag the second one out. Kingfisher - you did me proud, it was an amazing experience, I fear you've spoiled me for life. OptionTown, I'm sorry I ever doubted you - for me it was great, your support staff were fabulous, explained everything in great detail, your emails were timely, informative (and of course the one notifying me about the upgrade was sooooo exciting!)<br\/><br\/> And of course, the last word must go to Dr Mallya. Sir, you have done a grand job. (personally, you knocked spots off Virgin Upper Class) And should you ever feel the need to adopt me, then my mother would understand, so long as, of course that she gets upgraded.<br\/><br\/>Ms. Sarah Carter",
