What are Coroutines?
Coroutines = Co + Routines

Here, Co means cooperation and Routines means functions.
It means that when functions cooperate with each other, we call it as Coroutines.

Basically, a coroutine is a very light thread that runs a block of code
and has a similar life cycle, but can complete with a return value or an exception.

Technically,
a coroutine is an instance of a suspendable computation, a computation that may suspend.

Coroutines
aren't bound to a particular thread and can suspend in one Thread and resume execution in a different
one:
==================================================================================================
A few of the possibilities are as follows:

It can execute a few lines of functionA and then execute a few lines of functionB and then again a few lines of functionA and so on.
This will be helpful when a thread is sitting idle not doing anything, in that case, it can execute a few lines of another function.
This way, it can take the full advantage of thread. Ultimately the cooperation helps in the multitasking.

It will enable writing asynchronous code in a synchronous way. We will talk about this later in this article.

Overall, the Coroutines make the multitasking very easy.

So, we can say that Coroutines and the threads both are multitasking. But the difference is that threads are managed by the OS and
coroutines by the users as it can execute a few lines of function by taking advantage of the cooperation.

Now, you can understand the below paragraph, what the official website of Kotlin says

One can think of a coroutine as a light-weight thread. Like threads, coroutines can run in parallel, wait for each other and communicate.
The biggest difference is that coroutines are very cheap, almost free: we can create thousands of them, and pay very little in terms
of performance. True threads, on the other hand, are expensive to start and keep around. A thousand threads can be a serious challenge
for a modern machine.

There are two functions in Kotlin to start the coroutines which are as follows:

launch{}
async{}
Launch vs Async in Kotlin Coroutines
The difference is that the launch{} does not return anything and the async{}returns an instance of Deferred<T>, which has an await()function
that returns the result of the coroutine like we have future in Java in which we do future.get() to the get the result.

launch --> runs in the local scope, if we press back button from B activity then associated coroutine of B activity also gets destroyed.
GlobalScope.launch -->are top level coroutines and can survive the entire life of the application.

runBlocking: This function creates a coroutine and blocks the current Thread until the coroutine
finishes, returning its result value (Unit in this case).

launch: This function creates a new coroutine without blocking the current Thread and returns Job (ignored here).

delay: This function is a suspending (more on this later) function that delays the current coroutine without blocking the current thread.

suspend: A suspending function is a function that may suspend the execution of a coroutine,
without blocking the current Thread; therefore a suspending function must be called inside a coroutine—it can't be invoked from normal code.
The function must be marked with the suspend modifier. So, delay can be invoked inside runBlocking and launch,
both functions(among others) take a suspending lambda as the last parameter—
a suspending lambda is a lambda marked with the suspend modifier.


Dispatcher: It decides on which thread the coroutines will execute.

Dispatcher is of four types
1. Default -> it is similar to GlobalScope.launch, in separate bg thread
2. Unconfined -> it will run on Immediate parent of runBlocking coroutine context
3. Main -> this works on UI object
4. IO  -> Used for IO operations.


launch  -> GlobalScope.launch --> job : Job -> It returns the Job object
async   -> GlobalScope.async  --> Deferred<String> -> It returns the Deferred Object.
