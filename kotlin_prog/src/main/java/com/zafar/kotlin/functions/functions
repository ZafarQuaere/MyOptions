** A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single,
    related action.

1) Functions allow us to break the program into a bunch of steps and substeps
2) Functions encourages code reuse
3) Functions, if used properly, help us keep the code clean, organized, and easy to understand
4) Functions make testing (unit testing) easy, testing each small part of the program is easier
   than the complete program in a single go.

The definition of a pure function says that, if the return value of a function is completely dependent
on its arguments/parameters, then this function may be referred to as a pure function.

The definition also says that a pure function should not actively or passively cause side effects, that
is, it should not directly cause side effects, nor should it call any other function that causes side
effects.
