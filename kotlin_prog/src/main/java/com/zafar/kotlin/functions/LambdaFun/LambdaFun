Lambda, which can also be called anonymous functions, has a first-class citizen support in
Kotlin.

A high order function is a function which accepts another function as a parameter or returns another
function. We just saw how we can use a function as a property, so it's quite easy to see that we can
accept another function as a parameter or that we can return another function from a function.

The definition of a pure function says that, if the return value of a function is completely dependent
on its arguments/parameters, then this function may be referred to as a pure function.
