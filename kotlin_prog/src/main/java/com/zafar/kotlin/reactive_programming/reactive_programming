now break these things down sequentially to understand it better:
1) Observer subscribes to Observable
2) Observable starts emitting the items that it has in it
3) Observer reacts to whatever item the Observable emits

In Rx, the subscriber implements three methods to interact with observable:

2) onError(Exception):  Gets called if an exception is thrown
3) onCompleted():       Gets called when the data stream ends
