/*
You have an interface, I, and two classes, A and B. Both A and B implement I. In your code, you've
an instance of A and you want to create an instance of B from that A.
In traditional inheritance, it is not directly possible; you have to write a bunch of nasty codes to
achieve that, but class delegation is there to save you.*/
