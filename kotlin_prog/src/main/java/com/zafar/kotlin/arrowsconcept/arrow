Getting Started with Arrow
Arrow (http://arrow-kt.io/) is a Kotlin library that provides functional constructs, datatypes, and
other abstractions.
Kotlin syntax is powerful and flexible, and Arrow takes advantage of it to offer
features that don't come as standard.

Arrow is the result of combining the two most successful and popular functional libraries,
funKTionale and Kategory, into one.

In this chapter, we'll cover how to use existing functions to build new and richer functions. Some of
the topics that we'll cover are as follows:

Function composition
Partial application
Currying
Memoization
Pipes
Optics

Function        -->  Description
compose         -->  Takes the result of invoking the right-hand function as the parameter for the left-hand function.
forwardCompose  -->  Takes the result of invoking the left-hand function as the parameter for the right-hand function.
andThen         -->  Is an alias for forwardCompose
