What are streams?
You can think of streams as an abstract layer over a sequence of elements to
perform aggregate operations.
Confused? Let's take a code example and then try to understand:

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
val stream = 1.rangeTo(10).asSequence().asStream()
val resultantList = stream.skip(5).collect(Collectors.toList())
println(resultantList)
}
Output : 6,7,8,9,10
