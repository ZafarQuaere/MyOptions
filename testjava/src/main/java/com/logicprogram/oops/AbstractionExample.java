/*
* Best example to analyze and think when you talk about Client-Server based interaction using Abstract.
* This type of interaction we have done in Aidl example - (Aidl_Test_Cover)
* Try to assume this program as client-server interaction. Here you can consider that Bank Abstract class is client side
* and its implementation is on server side i.e SBI server.
* Here we have shown abstract class only at Client Side. But in real world senerio one Abstract class (with the
* same name as Client Abstract class) is also present at Server Side (as like client side Abstract class) as we have done in
* our AIDl_Test_Cover project. By this we can analyze that a pipeline will create for communication between both
* Client and Server(acts like mirror - which uses shared memory concept on same device for communication between two
* Apps using IBinder Interface of Android OS).
