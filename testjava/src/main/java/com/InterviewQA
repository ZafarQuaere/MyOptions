Map vs FlatMap
---------------
https://stackoverflow.com/a/26684710
Both map and flatMap can be applied to a Stream<T> and they both return a Stream<R>. The difference is that the map operation
produces one output value for each input value, whereas the flatMap operation produces an arbitrary number (zero or more)
values for each input value.

Multicast in RxJava

Multicasting
If I have this source observable or stream, and I’m casting the events from that source observable
to multiple subscribers it’s called multicasting. But why would I even bother multicasting?

(Single Responsibility, open/close, liskov substitution, interface, segregation, dependency inversion)
Liskov substitution :-> Ability to replace any instance of parent class with an instance of one of its child classes without negative side effects.
