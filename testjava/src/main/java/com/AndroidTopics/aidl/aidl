AIDL:

● Works like client & server application.
● Client app initiate some specific action, pass some data/request to server app for process, Server app process the data/request passed by client and return the appropriate result.
● Possible to pass custom object across apps.

To create a bounded service using AIDL, follow these steps:
1) Create the .aidl file
    This file defines the programming interface with method signatures.
2) Implement the interface
    The Android SDK tools generate an interface in the Java programming language, based on your .aidl file. This interface has an inner abstract
    class named Stub that extends Binder and implements methods from your AIDL interface. You must extend the Stub class and implement the methods.
3) Expose the interface to clients
    Implement a Service and override onBind() to return your implementation of the Stub class.
