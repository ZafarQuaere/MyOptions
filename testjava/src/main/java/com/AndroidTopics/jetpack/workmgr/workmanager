Work Manager(WM)
WorkManager is intended for tasks that are deferrable—that is, not required to run immediately—and required to run
reliably even if the app exits or the device restarts.
For example:
* Sending logs or analytics to backend services
* Periodically syncing application data with a server

WM makes it easy to schedule deferrable, asynchronous tasks that are expected to run even if the app exits
or device restarts.

Key Features:
-> Uses JobScheduler on devices with API 23+
-> Uses a combination of BroadcastReceiver + AlarmManager on devices with API 14-22
-> Add work constraints like network availability or charging status
-> Schedule asynchronous one-off or periodic tasks
-> Monitor and manage scheduled tasks
-> Chain tasks together
-> Ensures task execution, even if the app or device restarts
-> Adheres to power-saving features like Doze mode
