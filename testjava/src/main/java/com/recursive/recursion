You can learn recursion in the easiest way by going through below video link.

Basically there are 3 steps to solve a problem in recursion.

1) Base Case: Think of simplest possible input for this function.
2) Find relation: Think how the larger problem can be solved with the help of solution of smaller problem.
3) Generalise: Make generalised function that solves the problem, Put this all together into a mathematical function or tree.


Example: sum of n numbers using recursion:

public class SumOfN {
    public static void main(String[] arg) {
        int n = 5;
        int sum = sumOfN(n);
        System.out.println("sum of "+n+" is "+sum);
    }

    private static int sumOfN(int n) {
        if (n == 1)     // Base Condition
            return  1;
        return n + sumOfN(n -1); // relation if there is sum of 4, then sum of 5 can be find as sumOf(4) +5;
    }
}
