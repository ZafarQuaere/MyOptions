Design Pattern (DP):
-> A design patterns are well-proved solution for solving the specific problem/task.
                    OR
-> A DP is well structured solution for solving the specific problem or complete a task.

There are mainly three types of DP
1) Creational DP (CDP) -- How you create Objects
2) Structural DP (SDP) -- How you compose an Objects to form larger structure
3) Behavioral DP (BDP) -- How you coordinate Object interactions.

Types of CDP
● Singleton
● Dependency Injection
● Builder
● Factory method

Types of SDP
● Adapter -- this pattern lets two incompatible classes work together by converting the interface of a class into another interface the client expects.
● Facade --The Facade pattern provides a higher-level interface that makes a set of other interfaces easier to use.

Types of BDP
● MVC
● MVP
● MVVM
● Observer
● Clean Architecture

MVVM: (For UI representation look the attached img in the same folder)
● Model: It represents the data and the business logic of the Android Application. It consists of the business logic - local and remote data
         source, model classes, repository.
● View: It consists of the UI Code(Activity, Fragment), XML. It sends the user action to the ViewModel but does not get the response back
        directly. To get the response, it has to subscribe to the observables which ViewModel exposes to it.
● ViewModel: It is a bridge between the View and Model(business logic). It does not have any clue which View has to use it as it does not
             have a direct reference to the View. So basically, the ViewModel should not be aware of the view who is interacting with.
             It interacts with the Model and exposes the observable that can be observed by the View.

Android Design Pattern

Component       -- Design Pattern
ViewHolder      --      Singleton
Intent          --      Factory
Adapter         --      Adapter
View            --      Composite
Media           --      Cascade
Alert Dialog    --      Builder
Broadcast Receiver --   Observer
